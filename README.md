# Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species

This project is part of my Data Science learning journey on DataCamp, where I implemented clustering techniques to analyze and group Antarctic penguin species based on their physical characteristics. It serves as an introduction to unsupervised learning and exploratory data analysis using clustering algorithms.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to explore clustering techniques, such as K-Means, and identify meaningful groups among the dataset of Antarctic penguin species. Through this analysis, we gain insights into how species can be grouped based on shared characteristics without relying on labeled data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains measurements of Antarctic penguins, including:

- Species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)
- Culmen Length (mm)
- Culmen Depth (mm)
- Flipper Length (mm)
- Body Mass (g)
- Sex

The dataset is part of the popular Palmerpenguins package, widely used for data exploration and statistical learning.

## Key Steps in the Project

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - Normalized numerical features for better clustering performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   - Visualized data distributions and relationships between features using Seaborn and matplotlib.
   - Identified patterns and outliers in the data.

3. **Clustering Techniques**:

   - Implemented the K-Means clustering algorithm.
   - Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
   - Analyzed clustering results and compared them with the actual species labels (if available).

4. **Visualization of Results**:

   - Created scatter plots and cluster visualizations to interpret the clustering output.
   - Used color coding to represent clusters and compare them with true labels.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Key Learnings

- How to preprocess and normalize data for clustering.
- Application of the K-Means algorithm and evaluation of cluster quality.
- The importance of exploratory data analysis in understanding datasets.
- Visualization techniques to interpret and present clustering results.

## Conclusion

This project provided a hands-on opportunity to work with unsupervised learning techniques. It deepened my understanding of clustering algorithms and their applications in real-world scenarios.

## Future Work

- Explore other clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering.
- Incorporate additional features to improve clustering performance.
- Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA to visualize high-dimensional data.
